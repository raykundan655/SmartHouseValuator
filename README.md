# SmartHouseValuator

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts house prices using a trained machine learning model. Users can input house features via a web form or send JSON data through an API to receive price predictions. The ML model is trained using a dataset of housing features and prices.
- The *Flask web application* (app.py) and *HTML frontend* (HousePricePredictor.html) were scaffolded and refined using AI-based tools.
- The *machine learning model training* (HousePriceModel.py) and data preprocessing logic were *written manually by the author* without AI automation.

This hybrid approach allowed rapid deployment of the web interface while maintaining full control and customization over the ML pipeline.

## Dataset

This project uses the **[Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset)** from Kaggle, published by [Yasser H](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh).

- Features include:
  - Area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories
  - Main road, guest room, basement
  - Air conditioning, parking
- Target variable: *Price*

This dataset was saved as Housing.csv and used in house.py to train a RandomForestRegressor.

---


## Model Training

The model is trained using HousePriceModel.py with the dataset above. LabelEncoders are used for:
- mainroad
- guestroom
- basement
- airconditioning

The model and encoders are serialized using Pickle and loaded by the Flask app for prediction.


---


## Features

- Predict house prices instantly
- Built with Flask for web and API integration
- Trained using Random Forest Regressor
- Encodes categorical features using LabelEncoders
- Accepts both HTML form input and JSON API requests

---


##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask (Backend Web Framework)
- Scikit-learn (ML Model & Encoders)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- HTML + JavaScript (Frontend)
- Pickle (Model & Encoder Storage)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for EDA in development)

## Project Workflow

Step 1: Load Dataset

  └── Housing.csv
  

Step 2: Train Model (HousePriceModel.py)

  ├── Encode categorical features (LabelEncoder)
  
  ├── Train RandomForestRegressor
  
  └── Save:
  
      ├── housepricemodel.pkl
      
      ├── mainroad_le.pkl
      
      ├── guestroom_le.pkl
      
      ├── basement_le.pkl
      
      └── airconditioning_le.pkl
      

Step 3: Run Flask App (app.py)

  ├── Load model and encoders
  
  ├── Serve HTML form via /
  
  └── Expose API endpoint via /api/predict
  

Step 4: User Interaction

  ├── User inputs form OR sends JSON
  
  └── Flask processes → model predicts → returns predicted price
  

Step 5: Output

  ├── HTML view displays price
  
  └── OR API responds with JSON { "prediction": value }

##  How to Run the Project Locally

1. *Download the Project Files:*
   - Make sure you have all the following files and folders:
     - app.py
     - house.py
     - Housing.csv
     - All .pkl files (model and encoders)
     - A folder named templates containing index.html
     - requirements.txt
     - README.md

2. *Install Python:*
   - Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
   - You can verify this by opening any terminal or command prompt and typing python --version.

3. *Install Required Libraries:*
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt manually using pip or a package manager.
   - Libraries include:
     - Flask
     - Flask-Cors
     - numpy
     - pandas
     - scikit-learn
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn

4. *Train the Model (Optional):*
   - Open and run house.py if you want to retrain the model using Housing.csv.
   - This will generate the required model and encoder files (.pkl).

5. *Start the Web Application:*
   - Run the file app.py using Python.
   - It will start a local development server.

6. *Open the Web Page:*
   - Open any browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
   - You will see the House Price Prediction form.

7. *Use the Application:*
   - Fill in the form with house details like area, number of bedrooms, availability of guest room, etc.
   - Click *Predict* to get the estimated house price.
